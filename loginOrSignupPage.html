    <title>3 Gratitudes</title>

<!-- Welcome intro -->
<p> Welcome! <br><br>
Spending a few minutes every day to count the things your grateful for has been proven to significantly improve 
your long term well-being in just a few weeks 
(<a href="http://psycnet.apa.org/?&fa=main.doiLanding&doi=10.1037/0022-3514.84.2.377"> Emmons &#38 McCullough, 2003 </a>). 
<br><br> So I started writing down three things I was grateful for every day and it really worked wonders for me. 
But I soon lost these notes, lost track of whether I had done it and sometimes I didn’t have a pen and paper at hand 
when it came to mind. <br><br> So I made this web app to more conveniently record three things I’m grateful for and 
why every day. <br><br> If you would like to use it, you need to sign up or login below just so that you can keep a 
record for yourself. Its free. Enjoy. <br><br>
